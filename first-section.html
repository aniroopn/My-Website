								<h2>Research(Bioinformatics)</h2>
								<p>One of the significant challenges in genomics is understanding the functions of all genes.
                                    Proteins are the translations of the DNA gene sequences, the cells' main actors. Our research
                                    uses a computational approach to assign protein functions that rely on identifying close
                                    relatives. It delves into bioinformatics; we apply an AI method that Dr. Jernigan and his team
                                    created to annotate Proteins and Genes. We can select different viruses based on their genome
                                    size and gain comprehensive know-how of the functionalities. A real-world application would be
                                    using workflow for investigating the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Our homology
                                    search uses three main tools: BLAST, PROST, and Foldseek. They each have their uses within
                                    sequence or structural comparison. As for our validation process, we use FATCAT for flexible
                                    structural alignment and AlphaFold2 for predicting protein structures. Now, we also need a
                                    platform to showcase our results. We use JSONWP, which helps us transform the bioinformatics
                                    results into an interactive web page format. Our research takes the homologies found for each
                                    protein of a viral genome and compares them. This comparison is made between the different
                                    methods that find the homologies. We hope to find new insights into the viral genome and
                                    increase our knowledge about their effects on the host. Our research is fundamental because
                                    understanding viral proteins is the key to fixing the implications caused by them. </p>

                                <p> As an ISU Honors Leader at Iowa State University, I facilitate seminar sections for first-year honors students in collaboration with a co-leader. Responsibilities include planning syllabi, leading discussions, organizing events, and supporting students in and out of the classroom. I attend training sessions, assist with program activities, and liaise between students and staff, ensuring a supportive and enriching academic experience. This is not a work experience, but I feel that any opportunity provided to me to gain leadership experience seems like a work experience. So, I decided to add the FHP leader opportunity I got at ISU under work experience.</p>

                                <h2>Dining Employee</h2>
                                <p> As a Dining Employee at ISU Dining, I assist in preparing and serving meals to students and staff. My responsibilities include maintaining cleanliness and organization in dining areas and the kitchen, providing excellent customer service, and handling customer inquiries and concerns. Additionally, I collaborate with team members to ensure efficient dining operations and a positive dining experience for all people.								</p>
